We want to select missing values in a DataFrame, isnull and notnull return booleans indicating whether a value is missing, Missing values are a ubiquitous problem in data wrangling, yet many underestimate the difficulty of
working with missing data. pandas uses NumPy’s NaN (“Not A Number”) value to denote missing  values, but it is important to note that NaN is not fully implemented natively in pandas. For example, if we wanted to replace all
strings containing male with missing values, we return an error, To have full functionality with NaN we need to import the NumPy library first Oftentimes a dataset uses a specific value to denote a missing observation, such as NONE, -999, or ..
pandas’ read_csv includes a parameter allowing us to specify the values used to indicate missing values, We can also use pandas fillna function to impute the missing values of a column. Here, we show the places where Age is null using the isna 
function, and then fill those values with the mean age of passengers.
